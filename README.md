# Flood Prediction Model by Kenguruji

Flood prediction model by Kenguruji team for Arnes Hackathon 2024.

## Description

This repository contains water level and flood prediction models, made by Kenguruji team for Arnes Hackathon 2024.

## Structure

The code and data are organized into the following branches:

* `wip-map`: Contains initial work for displaying hydrological and meteorological stations from ARSO.
* `wip-database`: Contains initial work for database for storing measurements and predictions.
* `wip-heightmap`: Contains code for processing heightpoints and generating terrain heightmap.
* `wip-floodmap`: Contains code for flooding map based on river water levels and heightmap.
* `wip-models`: Contains code for model development, testing and analysis.

Website is stored in a separate repository: https://github.com/p1rko/SpletnaStranPoplave
